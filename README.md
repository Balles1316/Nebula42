# 🌍 Nebula42

*Nebula42* is a 2D educational browser game developed for the *NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 – Farm Navigators*.  
Our goal is to transform real NASA Earth data into an interactive experience that shows how climate recovery happens step by step — through gameplay, learning, and visual storytelling.

## 🎮 Overview

After a planetary catastrophe, the world has lost its balance.  
The player takes on the role of *Gamora*, the last guardian of life, who must collect the remaining elements of nature to restore Earth’s temperature and ecosystems.

Each level represents a different environmental stage — from burning deserts to a reborn planet — symbolizing how temperature, water, and vegetation interact in the real world.

## 🌡 Game Levels

1. *🔥 Level 0 – The Burning Lands (42°C)*  
   The planet is scorched and dry. Collect *heat orbs* to absorb excess energy and lower the temperature to 38°C.  
   Message: “Surface temperature critical. Begin cooling sequence.”

2. *💧 Level 1 – The Water Returns (38°C)*  
   Moisture reappears as you collect *water drops*. Small lakes begin to form, and the temperature drops to 33°C.  
   Message: “Moisture detected. Lakes forming.”

3. *🌱 Level 2 – Seeds of Life (33°C)*  
   Collect *seeds* and *water* to grow vegetation. The planet becomes fertile again, and temperature reaches 30°C.  
   Message: “Vegetation restored. Oxygen levels rising.”

4. *🐣 Level 3 – Awakening Life (30°C)*  
   Gather *eggs* and help life hatch again among the plants. Temperature stabilizes at 27°C.  
   Message: “Life returns. The balance is near.”

5. *💎 Level 4 – Humanity Reborn (27°C)*  
   Collect *gems of harmony* to complete the restoration. Humanity returns, and the planet shines in balance once more.  
   Message: “Congratulations — you’ve saved the world.”

## 🧠 Inspiration

The project was inspired by *NASA Earth science datasets*, including:
- Agriculture Production: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/human-dimensions/agriculture-production
- Floods: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/human-dimensions/floods
- Heat: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/human-dimensions/heat
- NASA Drought and Flood Maps: https://earthdata.nasa.gov

These datasets helped us understand the relationship between *temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation*, and inspired the environmental evolution across the five levels.

## 🧩 How It Works

Nebula42 is built using *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*, fully playable in a browser.  
Each level is a separate module (nivel1–nivel5), containing:
- A main.js file for the game logic.  
- A style.css file for consistent design.  
- A shared /resources folder for all backgrounds and sprites.

The player moves, jumps, and collects elements that affect temperature and environment progression.  
Once a level’s conditions are met (e.g., collecting enough orbs or seeds), the game automatically advances to the next stage.

## ⚙ Tools & Technologies

- *Languages:* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- *Design Tools:* Figma, Canva, Blender (for some background edits)  
- *Version Control:* GitHub  
- *NASA Data Sources:* MODIS, SMAP, NDVI datasets  
- *AI Tools Used:* ChatGPT (for voice narration script, English proofreading, and debugging support).  
  No AI-generated images were used — all visuals are created or edited manually using NASA-based references.

## 🌿 Impact

Nebula42 aims to raise *climate awareness* through play — turning real environmental data into an engaging visual story.  
It shows how small actions, like collecting water or planting seeds, can symbolize large-scale planetary recovery.

Our intention is to make *climate data feel alive* — accessible to everyone, especially younger audiences who learn better through interaction and visuals.
